Figure 2 （B）Heatmap showing the relative abundance of differentially abundant species-level genome bins between groups at 4d.
Figure 2B.sh was used for differential bacteria screening and marker source data were obtained. 
Heatmap data was put into the advanced heatmap tool in  OmicStudio tools at https://www.omicstudio.cn for drawing.
